# IoT-Air-Conditioner
My internet connected portable air conditioning unit with power, speed, and temperature controls via a HTTP API.

## Electronics
The code runs on an ESP8266 microcontroller. The controller is wired to the push buttons on on the air conditioner control panel.

The existing push buttons are trigged using opto-isolators rather than relays to avoid annoying clicks.

Circuit diagram and pictures to follow.
